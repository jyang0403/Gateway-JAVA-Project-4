# Project 4
Simulating wifi signal strength and stabilization in a room depending on wall materials, relative position to router, and the signals of nearby cells. Uses the custom-made Cell class!

This one took a lot of time because of how complicated the process of calculating signal strength was made to be, as it took place over several hard-to-understand steps that even the professors didn't really understand! It came out pretty well overall, but needs some slight tweaks to fix an oversight or two.
